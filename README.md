# Fully connected Neural Network for image classification
---
## This is a simple example of a fully connected neural network to classify images from [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset using [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and [Keras](https://keras.io/).

Dependencies
* Python3
* tensorflow
* Keras
* Jupter Notebook
---
Building and run
* If the above dependences are installed, a jupter notebook can be used to demonstrate the implementation using Keras. or by writting the following command from your terminal
  * python3 image classification using Keras.py
* For tensorflow version: write the following command from your terminal
  * python3 image classification using tensorflow.py
